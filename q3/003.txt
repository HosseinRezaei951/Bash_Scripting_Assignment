Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device, otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us.
Okay, so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device.
Yeah.
Do you agree?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
So maybe it should be for multiple devices.
And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil?
I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part.
No, I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now.
I think If we don't have so many buttons could be nice.
Few buttons.
Okay.
And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark?
Might be a good idea.
Yeah.
Okay.
And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain, what it shouldn't it should look like, or things like that?
Something which is not squarey maybe uh, not a box.
Mm.
With rou okay.
Like for okay.
Something like that, least fits in your hand.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
The basic requirement.
So.
Fit in your hand, yeah.
Only a buck.
And also it have, i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh To, to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall.
Mm-hmm.
Waterproof.
Water-proof as well.
And I think we should have a device Sorry.
Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't.
Maybe water-proof would be very original.
Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath.
Mm.
That could be uh Yeah but, it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very Yeah, mayb B But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well.
B it seems uh so, but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f And, and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it.
That's people they actually do it themselves.
Yeah.
directly.
I it will look a bulky in that case.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe we can sell uh all that together, so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well.
That might be good uh track to follow.
Like as an optional thing.
Optional or selled with it?
And I I think we should have something, most of the time I I lose my remote control.
We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping.
Yeah.
Maybe we can have uh But we don't design the T_V_.
