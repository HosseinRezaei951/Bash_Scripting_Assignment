President-elect Joe Biden announced Thursday he&#39;ll <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-denis-mcdonough-marcia-fudge-veterans-affairs-tom-vilsack-9e2faea3bf168bab198475dc8be1ec3d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nominate" class="link rapid-noclick-resp">nominate</a> Denis McDonough to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, and will name Susan Rice his head of the White House Domestic Policy Council. And while both of the nominees have lots of Washington experience, they&#39;re receiving criticism for their lack of experience in the departments they&#39;ve been named to.
McDonough was a chief of staff to former President Barack Obama, and was reportedly chosen for his skill in crisis management and deep experience in government operations, <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/12/10/biden-to-name-former-wh-chief-of-staff-denis-mcdonough-as-va-secretary-nominee/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a source familiar with the choice tells Military Times" class="link rapid-noclick-resp">a source familiar with the choice tells <em><u>Military Times</u></em></a>. And while he did handle the aftermath of the Obama administration&#39;s VA wait times scandal, McDonough isn&#39;t a veteran, and wasn&#39;t known for his work in veterans issues under Obama. AMVETS National Executive Director Joe Chenelly told <em>Military Times</em> he was &quot;surprised by this pick,&quot; while others were more explicit with their criticism.
I’ve met McDonough and have always been impressed by him. But there’s no world in which I would have ever envisioned him as <a href="https://twitter.com/DeptVetAffairs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:@DeptVetAffairs" class="link rapid-noclick-resp">@DeptVetAffairs</a> Sec. For an incoming Biden administration that says representation is a priority, this pick is the ultimate opposite of that commitment.

Rice was meanwhile ambassador to the United Nations and National Security Adviser under Obama. She was on Biden&#39;s vice presidential shortlist, and was also expected to be a top contender for secretary of state. But Rice has long been the target of Republican opposition, perhaps influencing Biden to pick her for a spot that doesn&#39;t require Senate confirmation. Still, the decision is surprising considering Rice has spent her career in foreign policy and doesn&#39;t have high-level experience in domestic policy roles.
