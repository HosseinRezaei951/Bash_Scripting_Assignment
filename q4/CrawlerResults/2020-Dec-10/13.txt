Dec 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook plans to deliver remarks at the United Nations&#39; Climate Ambition Summit on Dec. 12, the company confirmed on Wednesday.
The summit is being held on the fifth anniversary of the international Paris climate agreement and ahead of U.N. talks next year in Glasgow, Scotland. The Paris agreement is designed to limit a rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which scientists say could stave off the worst effects of climate change.
